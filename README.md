# RME-Tileset-Updater
This is a simple program developed by me, Lamonato, using C# and Windows Forms.

Its operation is very simple:

The system checks the ItemType categories (you choose) on the website tibia.wikia.com, searches for the ID of the corresponding item in the Otserver items.xml file to perform the linking and after that generates all the files and XML tags necessary to use in the Remere's Map Editor.

This program will be free and open source and all members of the Open Tibia Server community are invited to contribute and improve this idea.
Thank you very much!
